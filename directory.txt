paper scripts: functions and scripts used in the paper to generate figures and data. 

preprocessing and single cell analysis: 
- bigkahuna: starts with ND2 files, and outputs tiffstacks, background alignment parameters, 
             and bleach corrected channel data for full FOV. 

- single_cell_processing: crops cells from Tiff Stacks, does background alignment, then 
                          outputs bleach-corrected data for individual cells. 

Edge Velocity Heatmaps:
- Edge_trackingedits: performs coordinate window analysis on single cells. 
- getEdgeVelStats_edits: outputs protrusionlist and retractionlist matlab structures. 
  can set the parameters for what is indluced based on pixel size and average speed. 
  Default is 25 pixels minimum,  > 5 px/frame &  <-5 px/frame 

 equivalent to > 1.625 um/frame & < -1.625 um/frame at 0.325 um/px. 
equivalent to > 3.86 um/min & < -3.86 um/min at 25 s intervals 

 - plotFRET_retractions: plots compiled protrusion and retraction events for 1 or more trials  
   if you want, makes probability distributions and boxplots.

buildup plots
- FRETbuildup: manually select protrusion retraction transition events for a single cell. 
               Can specify how many frames on either side from T=0, transition point that you 
		want. 
-FRETbuildupplot: to compile individual buildup events from multiple trials, etc. You choose 
		a specific edge depth and roll with it. 

cross correlation
-plotcrosscorravgs: plots cross correlations for a single trial. The start array is which frame 
you wish to start at. Previously due to cell spreading they would be in the middle of the movie. 
For a regular cell choose 2. Velocity array is adjusted so that for a given frame n  of protein activity, 
the velocity is an average vector from n-1-> n and n -> n+1. Not perfect but the closest you can get. 

Each dataset uses the Central Limit Theorem to shift each distribution to normal with mean 0 and SD 1. 

-mult_trials_xcorr: for making plots for multiple independant trials

drug trial graphs and videos: 
 -get_granularity: 
 first section is used to make videos of drug additions. Uses RatioData_raw file structures. Normalizes 
 to frames pre-drug addition instead of normal bleaching correction. 
second section can be used to calculate specific values and granularity for a region of interest. 

- plotOsmoticRho: used to make drug resposne graphs. Control section is control, treated section labelled as hypo 
section. Hyper section currently commented out but can be used if you want to plot 2 different treatments compared to control 
at the same time. Does the same thing - normalizes to pre-frames drug addition, and for the treated cells to the entire control 
average.
