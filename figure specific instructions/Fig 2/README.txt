open preprocessing and the single cell analysis folder 
	- run preprocessing.m 
	- run single_cell_processing.m 

open Edge Velocity Heatmaps folder 
	- run Edge_trackingedits.m

(a) compile protrusion.mat and retraction.mat files to obtain average FRET values for all protrusions and retractions. Use MATLAB function normpdf to obtain probability density functions for each dataset. 

(b) Heat maps are generated using the  Edge_trackingedits.m script. 
   To generate the single cell cross correlation, open cross correlation folder 
	- run spatiotemp_xcorr.m script 

(c) open cross correlation folder 
	- run plotcrosscorravgs.m script 
	- run mult_trials_xcorr.m script
