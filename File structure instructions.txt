	> Raw 
	- in row_col_site_channel_frame format. (ie 1_1_1_CFP_1.tif), 
        - generally label them as CFP, FRET, mRuby for actin or myosin, and cyto for a cytoplasm marker. 


	> ND2 files 
	- store as background.nd2. run1.nd2, run2.nd2, etc. 
	- this stores them in alphabetical order so the code accesses them properly.

	- row_col_site_channel_frame.tif

        - row_col_site_channel_frame_RhoFRET_[0.7 1.3].tif (if you decide to make them).
